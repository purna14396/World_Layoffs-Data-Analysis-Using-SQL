### Project Overview
---

The primary goal of this project is to analyze global layoff data to identify trends, patterns, and insights. This analysis will help understand the factors influencing layoffs, the industries most affected and geographical trends.


### Data Source
---

Layoffs Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "layoffs.csv" file, containing detailed information about the number of layoffs and the percentage layoffs made by each company.

### Tools
---

SQL Server - Data Cleaning and Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
---


1. Removing Duplicates

    To identify duplicates we will add one column named row_num which will specify the number of duplicate rows.
    The rows having row_num > 1 will be deleted.

2. Standardizing the rows
   
  - Industry column cantained entries such as 'Crypto', 'Cryptocurrency', and 'Crypto Currency', each referring to the same sector which were consolidated into a 
    single term, 'Crypto'.Similarly for country column 'United States' and 'United States.' were consolidated into 'United State'.
  - The data type of date was changed into 'date' from 'text'.

3. Removing null and blank values

  -  Cases were found where companies had multiple entries, some of which were missing industry information while others were correctly categorized. To rectify these inconsistencies, I used self join to automatically fill all the null values in industry section.

4. Removing unwanted data and columns
   
- Rows where total_laid_off and perentage laid-off are null were deleted.
- row_num column was altered.


### Exploratory data analysis
---
1. 
```sql
SELECT MAX(date),  MIN(date)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs2;
```
The dataset records layoff data spanning from 2020-03-11 to 2023-03-06. This period captures significant global economic events, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, and the subsequent economic recovery phases. Analyzing data from this timeframe provides valuable insights into how different industries and regions were affected by these challenges.

2.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs2
WHERE  percentage_laid_off = 1;
```
The SQL query results indicate that the majority of companies that laid off their entire workforce (100% layoffs) are startups because the stage mentioned are early and they don't have much funds for the company.

3. Companies with the highest layoff in a single day are Google(12000), Meta(11000), Amazon(10000), Microsoft(10000), Ericsson(8500).

5. United states had the highest number of layoffs in these 3 years.

```sql
  SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off)
  FROM world_layoffs.layoffs2
  GROUP BY country
  ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

6. Total Layoffs with respect to Year
  
```sql
  SELECT YEAR(date) as year_, SUM(total_laid_off)
  FROM world_layoffs.layoffs2
  GROUP BY YEAR(date)
  having year_ is not null
  ORDER BY 1 ASC;
 ```

The year 2022 stands out as a period of considerable layoffs across various industries and regions.

7.Total layoffs with respect to stage of the business:

### Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis of the world layoff dataset from 2020 to 2023 provides valuable insights into global layoff trends, highlighting the significant factors and sectors affected. Key conclusions from the analysis include:

- Industries which affected the most due to pandemic were Consumer sector and Tech sector. Consumer sector was affected because the shift to online shopping,     
  supply chain issues, and rising costs.The tech sector also saw substantial layoffs, especially among post-IPO companies. Despite having considerable funds, these companies faced pressure to achieve profitability and maintain investor confidence, leading to operational restructuring and workforce cuts.

- Cities having most of the startups and businesss in United States is affected the most.
- The factors causing the layoffs were mostly economic,market and operational. By understanding these dynamics, businesses and policymakers can make         decisions to support affected industries and protect jobs to face future challenges.
